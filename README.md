# reminiscence
This android app allows users to store their favourite memories in categories such as: Student life, home, birthdays, work, festivals and hangouts. Users can give a title, describe them, add photos, set date/time of the event and share them. These "memories" are stored in this app.

This project is created from scratch by an unemployed student who has no degree or took no course in computer science/IT/programming. It would be really appreciated
if you could support me by giving advice in writing efficient code or directing me to the right resources or anything that would help me be a practical engineer.
