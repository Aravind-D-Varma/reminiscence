# reminiscence
This android app (unpublished- prototype phase) allows users to store their favourite memories in categories such as: Student life, home, birthdays, work, festivals and hangouts. Users can give a title, describe them, add photos, set date/time of the event and share them. These "memories" are stored in this app.

This project is created from scratch by an unemployed student who has no degree or took no course in computer science/IT/programming. Although I have written this code by myself, I have implemented clean coding practices. Once I have added a feature or removed a bug, I make sure that I clean the code by making it readable, easy to understand and to be maintainable for anyone who has just visited it. Afterall, programming is a language and there is an art in expressing it.

It would be really appreciated if you could support me by giving advice in writing efficient code or directing me to the right resources that would make me an effective software engineer. For example, I came to know about Git and Github from Reddit and it was really helpful in saving time. 

If you have anything: books, blogs, job referal or a product that you think would help me out, feel free to reach me at dl.aravind@gmail.com
